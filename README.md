#### ABOUT PAGE

- Decided to add text about the webpage in the image to the left and add a little image and little text to the right to make it look more appealing

![About page made in wireframes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kimskogfelter/Recipe-site/main/static/images/wireframes/Recipe%20site%20-%20About%20page.webp)

#### CONTACT PAGE

- Decided to make the contact page have the same layout as the about page with a picture to the left with a text describing what the user can do on that page. This because i want the webpage to have a similar theme

![Contact page made in wireframes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kimskogfelter/Recipe-site/main/static/images/wireframes/Recipe%20site%20-%20Contact%20page.webp)

#### REGISTER PAGE

#### The profile and add recipe pages was made after I had finished the wireframes. They were made when I did the tutorial on Youtube for the webpage. Before that I had in mind to only have a saved recipes page that showed up when the user was logged in insted of a profile page. But quickly realized that I needed more subheadings on the saved recipes page and there for choose to create the profile page insted 

#### SAVED RECIPES PAGE

![Saved recipes page made in wireframes, that is unused due to changing it to a profile page insted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kimskogfelter/Recipe-site/main/static/images/wireframes/Recipe%20site%20-%20view%20saved%20recipes%20page.webp)
