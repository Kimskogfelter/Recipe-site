### WIREFRAMES

---

#### HOME PAGE

- Changed the text and icons in the footer to be centered
- Decided to remove the recipes to their own page and insted have clickable links for different food type recipes

![Home page made in wireframes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kimskogfelter/Recipe-site/main/static/images/wireframes/Recipe%20site%20-%20Home%20page.webp)

#### RECIPES PAGE

- Removed the rating function due to not having enough time to finish that part

![Recipes page made in wireframes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kimskogfelter/Recipe-site/main/static/images/wireframes/Recipe%20site%20-%20Recipes%20main%20page.webp)

#### RECIPES DETAIL PAGE

- Added a comment function so a logged in user can comment on the recipe
- Removed the rating function due to not having enough time to finish that part

![Recipes detail page made in wireframes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kimskogfelter/Recipe-site/main/static/images/wireframes/Recipe%20site%20-%20Recipe%20page.webp)

#### ABOUT PAGE

- Decided to make the image to the left take up the whole height of the webpage to make it look more appealing

![About page made in wireframes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kimskogfelter/Recipe-site/main/static/images/wireframes/Recipe%20site%20-%20About%20page.webp)

#### CONTACT PAGE

- Decided to make the contact page have the same layout as the about page with a picture to the left with a text describing what the user can do on that page. This because i want the webpage to have a similar theme

![Contact page made in wireframes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kimskogfelter/Recipe-site/main/static/images/wireframes/Recipe%20site%20-%20Contact%20page.webp)

#### REGISTER PAGE

- Decided to make the log in and register page to have a similar look so the pages follows a similar theme
- Decided to remove the image to the left so the page only got the form left

![Register page made in wireframes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kimskogfelter/Recipe-site/main/static/images/wireframes/Recipe%20site%20-%20Registration%20page.webp)

#### LOG IN PAGE

- Decided to make the log in and register page to have a similar look so the pages follows a similar theme

![Log in page made in wireframes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kimskogfelter/Recipe-site/main/static/images/wireframes/Recipe%20site%20-%20Log%20in%20page.webp)

#### The profile and add recipe pages was made after I had finished the wireframes. They were made when I did the tutorial on Youtube for the webpage. Before that I had in mind to only have a saved recipes page that showed up when the user was logged in insted of a profile page. But quickly realized that I needed more subheadings on the saved recipes page and there for choose to create the profile page insted. Due to not having enough time i choose to delete the save recipes part of the profile and just have the recipes the user has created. 


### TESTING

---

- I tested the website in Chrome, Firefox and Edge browser to see that all pages loaded and that every link, button, form, images and navigation menu was working
- The site is also responsive which I tested in google chromes devtools by selecting different screensizes and test each function
- I tested that all text is easy to read and to understand
- The CSS code got valified through a CSS validator

  ![Picture of the results of the CSS validator](static/images/readme/css-validator.jpg)
- The HTML code got valified through a HTML validator
  I viewed each pages source code on the live website and copy and pasted that html code to the 
  html validator, so I wouldnt get any django errors. I got some other errors from the live page html code 
  which I couldnt see in the html template code in the IDE:
  - #### RECIPE DETAIL PAGE
  Said that I had stray < p >, < tr >, < td > and < th > tags, which I couldnt find in the html code in the IDE.
  All the other html pages was OK. 

  ![Picture of the results of the html validator](static/images/readme/html-validator.jpg)

    This project was deployed to Github.com. The following steps shows how you do it:

1. Log in to your Github.
2. Go to the Recipe Site repository in Github: [https://github.com/Kimskogfelter/Recipe-site]
3. Select Settings in the repository navigation menu at the top.
4. Select Pages at the left handside of the website.
5. Choose: Deploy from a branch as Source.
6. Choose: Main as branch and /root as folder and press save.
7. Wait a few minutes and press the Code menu to the top left.
8. At the right handside go to Deployment.
9. Then press the ![picture of the deployment icon on github](https://github.com/Kimskogfelter/Safari-Retreat/blob/main/assets/images/readme/deployment-icon.jpg) to go to the live website.

    This project was also deployed to Heroku.com. The following steps shows how you do it:
1. Start by creating a account on Herokus website
2. Then log in to your account and create the app for your website
3. When the app is created go to the settings tab
4. Reveal the config vars and add a KEY of DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC, and a VALUE of 1
5. In your IDEs terminal pip install gunicorn~=20.1 
6. In your IDE use this command: "pip freeze --local > requirements.txt" to update your requirements.txt file with the installed gunicorn
7. Create a file in your root directory named Procfile, it needs to be the same directory as your requirements.txt
8. In your procfile add this text: "web: gunicorn my_project.wsgi"
9. Change "my_project" to the name of your own project
10. Open your settings.py file and change your DEBUG settings to False. It should always be False when deploying your project to Heroku!
11. In your settings.py under the ALLOWED_HOSTS add this text ",'.herokuapp'" 
12. Now git add, commit and push all the changes to Github
13. Return to your Heroku dashboard and go to the deploy tab
14. Choose to connect your Heroku account to your Github account 
15. When your Heroku account is connected to your Github account search for your project repo name and choose it
16. Then scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the "deploy branch" button to start a manual deployment
17. When the deployment is done you'll see a "View" button at the bottom of the page
18. Press that button to view your deployed app

    This project uses a database from ElephantSQL. The following steps shows how you create a database through ElephantSQL:
1. Log in to or create a new account at the ElephantSQL database webpage
2. Click at "create new instance"
3. Choose a name and plan for your database, name could be the same as your webpage to make things easy
4. You can leave the tags field blank
5. Click on the "select region" button and choose a region/data center close to you and then press the "review" button
6. Check that all information is correct and press the "create instance" button
7. Click on your newly made database
8. Click on the STATS menu and check that the PostgresSQL version is higher then 12 (if its not higher then 12 you need to go back to step 1 and create a new instance and choose a different data center. If you are in Europe choose one thats in Europe)
9. When your PostgresSQL version is  12 or higher go to the DETAILS menu and copy the URL
10. Go back to your IDE and create a new file named "env.py" in your root directory, the same as your Procfile 
11. Open the ".gitignore" file and add the "env.py" to that
12. Open your "env.py" file and add this text: "import os
os.environ.setdefault('DATABASE_URL', '<your-database-url>')"
13. Change the text "<your-database-url>" to your own data base URL you copied from ElephantSQL
14. Pip install dj-database-url~=0.5 and psycopg2~=2.9, these are required to be able to connect to your PostgresSQL database
15. Pip freeze your requirements.txt file
16. Open your "settings.py" and add this at the top of it "import os
import dj_database_url
if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
import env"
17. Still in your "settings.py" file, find the local sqlite3 database that Django provides and comment that one out so you dont use it
18. Then add this text under the local database you just commented out "DATABASES = {
 'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
 }" 
 19. Now that your project is connected to the database you need to use the migrate command in your terminal, copy this text to your terminal and press enter "python manage.py migrate"
 20. In your "settings.py" file change DEBUG to False! IMPORTANT 
 21. Now git add, commit and push all the changes to Github
 22. Go to your Heroku dashboard and go to the DEPLOY tab and do a manual deployment
 23. When the deployment is done go to the settings tab and reveal your config vars
 24. Add a new confiv var with the KEY "DATABASE_URL" and the VALUE is your ElephantSQL URL
 25. Now your deployed app should be connected to your new PostgresSQL database

### ISSUES

- I noticed that the divs containing each recipe on the recipes page are different sizes on the smaller screens. 
When the recipe divs are 2 or 1 per row they get different sizes. I have tried to change the bootstrap classes to make that
dissapear so that all the recipe divs are the same size, but without any luck. 
- This project have been a real struggle for me. To understand Django took a long time and it was when I had 2 weeks left to finish this I started
to understand Django a little bit. Hopefully I have written enought own code to get a pass and I will continue to study to learn Django even more.
